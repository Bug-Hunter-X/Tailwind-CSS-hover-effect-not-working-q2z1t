The issue was resolved by ensuring the parent element of the targeted element didn't have any conflicting styles or `pointer-events` set to `none`.  Here's the corrected code:

```html
<div>
  <div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700">
    Hover over me!
  </div>
</div>
```

The addition of a parent div resolved the issue.
